### Graph

#### Basic
- The elements in the graph are called vertices.
- The relationship between two vertices is called the edge.
- The numberof edges connected to the vertices is called degree.
- Divided into and out of the directed graph.
- Weighted graph : Each side has a weight.
#### Graph storage
##### Adjacency Matrix
- The underlying depends on a two-dimensional array.
- Intuitive and easy to access.
- Waste storage.
#### Adjacency List
- Save space for storage but waste time when used.
- Use hash table chain storage.
