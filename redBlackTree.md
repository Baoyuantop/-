# Red Black Tree

### Balanced binary search tree
> Balanced binary tree: The height difference between the left and right subtrees of any node in the binary tree cannot be greater than 1.

1. The Balanced binary search tree is binary search tree and Balanced binary tree.
2. Solve the problem of time complexity degradation in the case of frequent binary insertion tree dynamic update such as frequent insertion and deletion.

### Red Black Tree

1. Nodes are marked as black and one is marked as red.
2. The root node is black.
3. Each leaf node is a black empty node.
4. Any adjacent node cannot be red at the same time.
5. Each node, from that node to all its reachable leaf nodes, contains the same number of black nodes.
6. Height approximate log2n.
7. The time complexity of the operation is O(logn).
